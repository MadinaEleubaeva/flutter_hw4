This code is a Flutter application that displays a list of users and the companies they work for. In hear I use AppBar, ListTile,  Data Lists, Main Function, MaterialApp and Scaffold.
The AppBar widget in Flutter is a material design widget that represents the app bar at the top of the screen. And we see AppBar background color: Blue
AppBar:
The app bar is set using the AppBar widget.
It displays the title "METANIT.COM" at the top of the app.
ListTile:
Each item in the list is represented by a ListTile widget.
It displays the user's name,sets a face icon as leading, a phone icon as trailing, and the company the user works for as a subtitle.
Data Lists(names)
users: Contains the names of users - "Tom", "Bob", "Sam", and "Mike".
companies: Contains the names of companies - "Google", "Microsoft", "Apple", and "JetBrains".
Main Function:
The main function is the entry point of the application.
It calls runApp, which initializes and runs the Flutter application.
MaterialApp and Scaffold:
MaterialApp widget sets up the material design specific configurations for the app.
Scaffold widget provides the basic structure of the app's layout, including app bar, body, and more.
Also we learnt about 3 types of Scaffold: App Bar, Text and Image. I use App Bar in this code.
